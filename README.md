ScrumVoter
==========

An Android app for use with Planning Poker (an Agile estimation technique).

As your team reviews tasks and votes on the level of effort to complete each task, use this tool to share your vote. First, pick a your score, then push the Vote button. (Be secretive so no one else on your team knows how you are voting! ;) ) Then, when it is time to vote, push the Reveal button and share it with your teammates. Use the back button to pick and vote again.

To change the available scores, edit res/layout/strings.xml and rebuild this project. I may later add an editing or import/export feature for this.

Cheers and enjoy!
